  ## Description

 Simple command line chatroom server and client using python, this is built following these articles:<br>
 
 [https://pythonprogramming.net/server-chatroom-sockets-tutorial-python-3/ (server)](https://pythonprogramming.net/server-chatroom-sockets-tutorial-python-3/) <br>
 [https://pythonprogramming.net/server-chatroom-sockets-tutorial-python-3/ (client)](https://pythonprogramming.net/client-chatroom-sockets-tutorial-python-3/?completed=/server-chatroom-sockets-tutorial-python-3/)<br>

 The purpose of this project is to gain an understanding of sockets and threading in python and build on the basic foundation provided by the articles above. The primary goal is to
 learn and add functionality by collaborating with coleagues and friends to create an interesting app. I am hoping to go beyond a basic CLI client/server to incorporate django
 and create a web client along with mobile clients, ultimately providing a portable suite of apps for encrypted peer-to-peer communication. 
 Once I have the foundation of the app it's likely the repo will be forked to rename the project and build from there.

    Built Using:
    
    Python
    Sockets
    Threading
    Django
